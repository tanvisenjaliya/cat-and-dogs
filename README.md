## Dataset
Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/scitdeeplearninglab/dogs-vs-cats-small

Dataset consisting of 3 sub folder with

- Training images (1000 cat images and 1000 dog images)
  
- Validation images (500 cat images and 500 dog images)

- Test images (500 cat images and 500 dog images)

Build the CNN model
1. With 4 Conv2D layers with 32, 64, 128, and 128 filters of sixe 3 x 3 each (neurons)
2. Alternating MaxPooling2D layers
3. One Flatten layer
4. Two Dense layers with 512 and 1 neurons each

later used data augmentation and compared the results.
